# Robust cross-cohort stool microbiome signatures of chronological age and biological aging across 16S amplicon and shotgun metagenomics sequencing

This repository contains all files required to reproduce the microbiome modeling and effect estimation for the SHIP cohort in the study.

## Repository structure

### `Microbiome_modelling/`
Contains all necessary files and scripts to construct personalized microbiome community models. And compute individual maximum secretion fluxes for each microbe in the community.

### `Calculate_effects/`
Contains R scripts to compute **ecological** **total** and **direct** effects from the microbiome models.
