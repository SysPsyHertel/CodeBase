## The folder "CRC_study" contains all necessary files for computing microbiome community models, redundancy measures and statistical analysis of the CRCstudy
## The folder "IBD_study" contains all necessary files for computing redundancy measures and statistical analysis of the IBD study
## The file "comparisons_redundancy.R" compares the derived measures of functional redundancy with traditional appraoches that investigate community-level redundancy (based onRao's quadratic entropy).
- compute_redundancy_measures._IBD.R (computes redundancy measures using the FunRed package (https://github.com/SysPsyHertel/FunRed) and prepares the data for statistical analysis)
- statistical_analysis_IBD.R (statistical analysis of the IBD study)
