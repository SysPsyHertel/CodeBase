### Scripts for the publication "Integrating population-based metabolomics with computational microbiome modelling identifies methanol as a urinary biomarker for protective diet-microbiome-host interactions"

This repository contains all the necessary files for microbiome community modeling and statistical analyses.


## Folders

### `Microbiome_Modeling/`
Contains scripts needed for:
  
- Creating microbiome community models and computing maximum secretion fluxes with adapted diet constraints
- Calculating individual maximum secretion fluxes
- Identifying which strains in AGORA2 can secrete methanol

### `Statistical analysis of SHIP data`
Contains scripts needed for:
- Descriptive anaylsis of SHIP-START-0 and SHIP-TREND-0
- Linear regression linking dietary intake to metabolite levels
- Exploration of urinary methanol in relation to lifestyle factors
- Investigation of urinary methanol as a predictor of mortality rate
- Predicting Urinary Methanol from FFQ Data
